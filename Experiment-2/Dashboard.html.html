            <td>The Path tracing Robot is an programmed robot that
can automatically identifies a path .according to the
path drawn, it goes after the path with the help of an
IR sensor affixed to the robot. The path drawn should
be a Blackline over a white surface thus avoiding any
encounter error. Path follower robot also consists of a
Proximity sensor that detects any barrier ahead of the
moving robot thus resisting any irrelevant crash. Other than the Path following capabilities this robot also has
the competence map the navigate junction to store the
data in the cloud and move in the particular region
without any error and decides on which junction to
turn and which junction ignore this would require
robot to have desired angle to turn and junction
counting capacities. Through feedback mechanism the
robot has the ability to man oeuvre to particular
direction and stay on the course by constantly
checking the false shift through the control system
used must understand the path thus creating a simple
closed loop system. Path follower robot is developed
and coded in such a way that it performs assigned work
thoroughly without any fault and identifies given path
The Arduino will the receive the transmitted signal ,
senses and identifies the particular lane and move in
desired direction. To control the speed and direction of
the path follower robot a device called micro controller
is fixed to process the received input signal. According
to the received signal it controls the direction and
speed of the path follower robot. This way the path
follower robot works without any fault.
An ultrasonic sensor is used with an ability to identify
an object and calculate the length between the obstacle
and robot. Through the sound frequency passed
through it as it affixed to the forefront of the path
following robot. It measures the length between the
obstacle and the path following robot and the obstacle.
Ultrasonic sensor transmits the sound wave of
particular frequency and identifies the received
bounced signal from the obstacle.
This can be applied for military purposes, delivery
services, transportation systems, blind assisting
applications </td>
